    Tasks:
    *Fix 3-in-a-row win (works with wild card in SYM1 slot)
    *Add 5-in-a-row wins
    *Show winning row/column with a highlight
    *Allow other row to count as a win
    Set different weights for multiplying wins based on characters
    *Allow addition of multiple winning rows
    *Show winning amount in VictoryScreen
    *Create new game on ENTER, control with UP, DOWN, and SPACE
    *Use random selection of characters from available pool
    *Add Lose Screen when out of money
    *Add click to create New Game on home screen, now mobile users can interact

    Move player info like money and wager from side animation to a line a top, right under title.

    We want an anti-win scenario,  perhaps where a player loses all coins and can't bet any more. Maybe one that says TOO WILD when player gets 3 wilds in a row (possibly impose a penalty, like lose half coins).

    Create completion screen "You did it! Cash in your Digital Coins now to buy passage to our sexy, slutty, semi-cyber space" when user exceeds 100 coins.
