    Tasks:
    *Fix 3-in-a-row win (works with wild card in SYM1 slot)
    *Show winning row with a highlight
    *Allow other row to count as a win
    Set different weights for multiplying wins based on characters
    *Allow addition of multiple winning rows
    Show winning amount in VictoryScreen
    *Create new game on UP, DOWN, and SPACE

    We need a goal of success that requires more than just pulling the lever and getting random options.
    Simplest solution seems to be to allow player ability to increase/decrease bet amount.
    
    Let's try an approach where increasing bets increases lines to check.  I'll find some math to figure out an appropriate amount needed to win per selected line vs bet amount.
    (Need to figure out probability, and can adjust with how many characters exist in each pool.)

    Win total: 100
    Bet 1: Middle line, Win 10
    Bet 2: All 3 Horizontal lines, Win 5
    Bet 5: All 8 lines, Win 3


    We need a system of picking the set of characters from a larger pool.  For example, we could have 100 sexy photos, but we only want to load 10 characters in a game (for higher probability of winning).
    So I want a pool of characters, right now we can just have the 7;
    then I want to have a function that runs on the creation of each new game that pulls random characters from this pool.
    

    We want an anti-win scenario,  perhaps where a player loses all coins and can't bet any more. Maybe one that says TOO WILD when player gets 3 wilds in a row (possibly impose a penalty, like lose half coins).


    We need a starting screen that greets people and loads a new Game on  pressing either pussy/anus button or pulling lever (indicated by up arrow, down arrow, and space bar).
